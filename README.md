# WhatsTheWeather
Weather application based on Android Course from Udemy (You can find the course here: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-android-oreo-developer-course). 

A few options were added by me: showing temperature, humidity and pressure. 

Just put the name of any city you want and see what's the weather there! 

The app is using https://openweathermap.org/ API.
